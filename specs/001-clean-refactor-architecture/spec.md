# Feature Specification: Clean and Refactor Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `001-clean-refactor-architecture`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "make this project a well polished project, without unecessary bloat and unused code. I want a modulear clean design code. I want my folder structure respected and clean the scripts folder. The architecture of this project is that I have a custom frontend that has implemented the user login, notifications,email set up by pocketbase and on a custom interactions you can have it made so that you can run rivet workflows (check documentation) that return data from those workflows and updates rows in the pocketbase database. In this instance I prototyped with a story generation workflow and frontend reflects that. I want to clean the project, eliminate unimportant code and refactor existing code to align with the solid programing principles applied to those constraints"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Remove Unused Code and Dependencies (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the PocketAI project, I need to remove all unused code, dependencies, and files so that the codebase is lean, maintainable, and focused only on the core functionality (user authentication, notifications, email setup, and Rivet workflow execution).

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all other improvements. Reduces maintenance burden, improves build times, and eliminates confusion about what code is actually used.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by building the project, running all existing functionality, and verifying no broken imports or missing dependencies exist after cleanup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current project with prototype code, **When** unused files are removed, **Then** all existing functionality continues to work without errors
2. **Given** package.json and go.mod files, **When** unused dependencies are removed, **Then** build times improve and no missing dependency errors occur
3. **Given** the cleaned codebase, **When** running linting tools, **Then** no unused import warnings are generated

### User Story 2 - Refactor Code to Follow SOLID Principles (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need the codebase to strictly follow SOLID principles so that components have single responsibilities, are easily extensible, and maintain clear separation of concerns between frontend, PocketBase, and Rivet workflows.

**Why this priority**: Ensures long-term maintainability and enables future feature development without breaking existing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining each component and verifying it has a single clear responsibility and follows dependency inversion patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing frontend components, **When** refactored to follow SRP, **Then** each component handles only UI logic, API calls, or state management - not multiple concerns
2. **Given** PocketBase extension code, **When** refactored to follow OCP, **Then** new endpoints can be added without modifying existing core functionality
3. **Given** the API layer, **When** refactored to follow LSP, **Then** all API contracts remain consistent and interchangeable with mock implementations

---

### User Story 3 - Organize Scripts Folder and Improve Developer Experience (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need a clean and well-organized scripts folder with clear documentation so that development workflows are predictable, discoverable, and maintainable.

**Why this priority**: Improves developer onboarding and reduces friction in daily development tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by following script documentation to set up the project from scratch and verifying all development workflows work as documented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current scripts folder, **When** reorganized and cleaned, **Then** only necessary scripts remain with clear naming and documentation
2. **Given** the improved scripts, **When** a new developer follows setup instructions, **Then** they can get the project running in under 10 minutes
3. **Given** the centralized environment management, **When** scripts are refactored, **Then** the symlink pattern for .env.local remains intact and functional

---

### User Story 4 - Modularize Component Architecture (Priority: P4)

As a developer, I need components to be properly modularized with clear interfaces so that frontend, PocketBase extensions, and Rivet workflows can be developed and tested independently.

**Why this priority**: Enables parallel development, easier testing, and clear architectural boundaries.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by developing or modifying one component without requiring changes to other components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the frontend components, **When** modularized properly, **Then** story generation UI can be developed independently of authentication components
2. **Given** PocketBase extensions, **When** properly modularized, **Then** Rivet workflow endpoints can be added without affecting user management endpoints
3. **Given** the modular architecture, **When** running integration tests, **Then** each component can be tested in isolation with mock dependencies

### Edge Cases

- What happens when legacy code is deeply intertwined with current functionality?
- How does the system handle broken symlinks during script reorganization?
- What happens when SOLID principle refactoring breaks existing API contracts?
- How does the system maintain backwards compatibility during modularization?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all unused code files, imports, and dependencies while maintaining existing functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST refactor all components to follow Single Responsibility Principle with clear, single purposes
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement Open/Closed Principle allowing extensions without modifying existing core logic
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain Liskov Substitution Principle with consistent API contracts and interchangeable implementations
- **FR-005**: System MUST follow Interface Segregation Principle with components depending only on interfaces they actually use
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement Dependency Inversion Principle with abstractions rather than concrete implementations
- **FR-007**: Scripts folder MUST contain only necessary development and deployment scripts with clear documentation
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain centralized environment management via symlinked .env.local files
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve existing folder structure: client/, pocketbase/, rivet/, scripts/
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain all current functionality: user authentication, notifications, email setup, Rivet workflow execution

### Key Entities

- **Frontend Module**: React components organized by feature with clear separation between UI, API calls, and state management
- **PocketBase Extension**: Go extension with modular endpoint handlers and middleware following dependency injection patterns
- **Rivet Workflow Interface**: Standardized contract for workflow execution and data exchange with PocketBase
- **Development Scripts**: Organized collection of setup, build, test, and deployment automation
- **Environment Configuration**: Centralized configuration management with symlink-based distribution
