# Implementation Plan: Clean and Refactor Architecture

**Branch**: `001-clean-refactor-architecture` | **Date**: 2025-10-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-clean-refactor-architecture/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Comprehensive refactoring initiative to eliminate unused code, implement SOLID principles, and create a scalable architecture for AI workflow execution. Focus on modular design that supports story generation workflows while enabling future complex workflow types. Technical approach involves systematic code analysis, dependency cleanup, architectural restructuring, and comprehensive testing.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.23.0 (PocketBase), TypeScript 5.x (Frontend), Node.js 18+ (Development)  
**Primary Dependencies**: PocketBase v0.29.1, React 18, Vite 4.5, Rivet CLI, TailwindCSS, @tanstack/react-query  
**Storage**: PocketBase SQLite (embedded), File-based environment configuration (.env.local symlinks)  
**Testing**: Go testing framework, Vitest (frontend), ESLint/Stylelint (static analysis), Integration test scripts  
**Target Platform**: Web application (Linux/macOS/Windows development, Linux production)
**Project Type**: Web application with AI integration - multi-service architecture  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms workflow response time, <3s frontend build time, <10min developer setup  
**Constraints**: Maintain existing folder structure (client/, pocketbase/, rivet/, scripts/), preserve all current functionality  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-tenant application, ~50 files to refactor, 4 core components, extensible to multiple workflow types

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **SRP**: Feature scope clearly assigned to single component (frontend/pocketbase/rivet/scripts)
- [x] **OCP**: Implementation extends existing interfaces without modifying core logic
- [x] **LSP**: All API contracts maintain backward compatibility and substitutability  
- [x] **ISP**: Components depend only on interfaces they actually use
- [x] **DIP**: Implementation depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- [x] **Environment**: Uses centralized `.env.local` configuration via symlinks
- [x] **Integration**: Includes end-to-end testing across component boundaries

```

**Structure Decision**: Maintaining existing 4-folder structure (client/, pocketbase/, rivet/, scripts/) while introducing feature-based organization within each component. This preserves the constitutional separation of concerns while enabling modular development within each layer. The refactoring will organize code by feature (auth, workflows, stories) rather than technical layer, improving maintainability and scalability for multiple workflow types.

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitutional violations requiring justification - all refactoring aligns with established principles*
