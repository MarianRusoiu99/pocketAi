# Cleanup Summary: Removed Old JavaScript Implementation Files

## Files Removed ✅

### 🗑️ **Old PocketBase Binary Implementation**
- `pocketbase` - The old PocketBase binary
- `download-pocketbase.sh` - Script to download PocketBase binary
- `start-pocketbase.sh` - Old binary-based startup script
- `dev-setup.sh` - Old development setup script (replaced with Go-based version)

### 🗑️ **Legacy Directory Structure**
- `src/` - Old source directory that was left from original structure
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Duplicate styles file (kept in client/src/styles/)

## Files Updated 🔄

### 📝 **Configuration Files**
- `package.json` - Removed old binary-based scripts, kept only Go-based ones
- `.gitignore` - Removed old pocketbase binary references
- `README.md` - Updated to focus on Go-based approach as primary
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Simplified to Go-based approach

### 📝 **Script Naming**
- `dev-setup-go.sh` → `dev-setup.sh` (renamed to be the main setup script)
- Updated script headers and descriptions

## Current Clean Structure 🏗️

```
/
├── main.go                  # Go-based PocketBase entry point
├── go.mod                   # Go dependencies
├── pocket-app              # Built Go binary (gitignored)
├── dev-setup.sh            # Main development setup script
├── start-go-pocketbase.sh  # Go-based startup script
├── client/                 # React frontend
├── pb_hooks/               # JavaScript hooks (still supported)
├── pb_migrations/          # Database migrations
└── ... (other necessary files)
```

## Benefits of Cleanup 🎯

1. **Simplified Workflow**: One primary approach (Go-based)
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No duplicate scripts or binaries
3. **Cleaner Repository**: Removed legacy files
4. **Consistent Documentation**: All docs point to Go-based approach
5. **Maintainable**: Easier to maintain with single approach

## What's Still Supported ✅

- ✅ JavaScript hooks in `pb_hooks/` (via jsvm plugin)
- ✅ Database migrations in `pb_migrations/`
- ✅ All existing PocketBase features
- ✅ React frontend with full development workflow
- ✅ All existing collections and data

## Quick Start After Cleanup 🚀

```bash
# One command to rule them all
./dev-setup.sh
```

Your project is now clean and focused on the Go-based PocketBase approach! 🎉
