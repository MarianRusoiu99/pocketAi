# Tasks: Clean and Refactor Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-clean-refactor-architecture/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification, so implementation-focused tasks are prioritized.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `client/src/`, `pocketbase/src/`, based on plan.md structure
- Maintaining existing folder structure: client/, pocketbase/, rivet/, scripts/

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on clean codebase from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- All tasks marked [P] within a story can run in parallel
- Tasks without [P] have dependencies on completion of previous tasks in the same story
- Each story checkpoint validates independent functionality

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: T007-T013 can run in parallel after T006 completes
- **User Story 1**: T014-T019, T021 can run in parallel; T020, T022, T023 are sequential
- **User Story 2**: T024-T028, T034-T036 can run in parallel; T029-T033, T037-T040 are sequential
- **User Story 3**: T041-T044 can run in parallel; T045-T050 are sequential  
- **User Story 4**: T051-T055, T058-T060 can run in parallel; T056-T057, T061-T066 are sequential
- **Polish Phase**: T067-T069, T072-T073 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all service interfaces together:
Task: "Extract story generation service interface in pocketbase/src/services/story_generation_service.go"
Task: "Extract Rivet client service interface in pocketbase/src/services/rivet_client.go"

# Launch all repository implementations together:
Task: "Create story repository implementation in pocketbase/src/repositories/story_repository.go" 
Task: "Create user repository implementation in pocketbase/src/repositories/user_repository.go"

# Launch all frontend feature organization together:
Task: "Create custom React hooks in client/src/features/stories/hooks/useStoryGeneration.ts"
Task: "Organize authentication components in client/src/features/auth/"
Task: "Organize workflow components in client/src/features/workflows/"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories) 
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Clean codebase)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test that all existing functionality works without unused code
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Clean MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (SOLID Architecture)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Clean Scripts)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Modular Architecture)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Cleanup)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (SOLID Principles) 
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Scripts Organization)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Modularization)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within the phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability  
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Success criteria: 20% build time improvement, 15% code reduction, <10min setup time, zero linting violations
- Maintain existing folder structure: client/, pocketbase/, rivet/, scripts/
- All existing functionality must continue working: authentication, notifications, email, story generation
