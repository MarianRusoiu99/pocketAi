Define the task to achieve, including specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

I want to refactor the PocketBase project structure to execute rivet flows more easily and simplify the whole setup. You can look at the official example created by rivet in their github https://github.com/Ironclad/rivet-example

The goal is to create a more modular and organized structure that allows for easier integration and execution of rivet flows. This may involve reorganizing files, updating import paths, and ensuring that the new structure is well-documented and easy to navigate.

Success criteria for this task include:

1. A clear and logical project structure that separates concerns and makes it easy to find relevant code.
2. Updated documentation that reflects the new structure and provides guidance on how to use it.
3. Minimal Frontend integration that runs my flow and processes stories using the new structure.
4. Successful execution of existing rivet flows in the new structure without any issues.
5. A plan for how to incorporate future changes and improvements to the project structure as needed.
