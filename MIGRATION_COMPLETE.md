# 🎉 Migration Complete!

## ✅ Successfully Migrated to Go-based PocketBase

Your project has been successfully migrated from a binary PocketBase setup to a clean Go-based PocketBase backend with React frontend.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start both backend and frontend:**
   ```bash
   ./dev-start.sh
   ```

2. **Or start individually:**
   ```bash
   # Backend only
   ./start-go-pocketbase.sh
   
   # Frontend only (in another terminal)
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

### 🌐 Access Points

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8090/api/
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:8090/_/

### 📁 Clean Project Structure

```
/home/vali/Apps/pocket/
├── main.go                    # Go-based PocketBase backend
├── go.mod, go.sum            # Go dependencies
├── POCKETBASE_GUIDE.md       # Comprehensive extension guide
├── dev-start.sh              # Start both servers
├── start-go-pocketbase.sh    # Backend-only script
├── client/                   # React frontend + all Node.js tooling
├── pb_hooks/                 # PocketBase hooks (currently empty)
└── pb_migrations/            # Database migrations (cleaned)
```

### 🧹 What Was Cleaned Up

- ✅ Removed all legacy PocketBase binary files
- ✅ Moved all Node.js tooling to `client/` directory
- ✅ Updated Husky/lint-staged to be frontend-only
- ✅ Removed problematic migration files that prevented startup
- ✅ Fixed all backend startup issues
- ✅ Updated Go dependencies to latest PocketBase
- ✅ Cleaned up all problematic JS hooks

### 🛠 Next Steps

1. **Set up admin user**: Visit http://localhost:8090/_/ to create your first admin user
2. **Create collections**: Use the admin dashboard or follow `POCKETBASE_GUIDE.md`
3. **Add custom logic**: Extend PocketBase using the patterns in `POCKETBASE_GUIDE.md`
4. **Configure frontend**: Update API endpoints in your React app to use `http://localhost:8090/api/`

### 📚 Documentation

- **PocketBase Extension Guide**: `POCKETBASE_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide for extending PocketBase
- **Official PocketBase Docs**: https://pocketbase.io/docs/

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- The migration files have been cleaned to ensure a fresh start
- JS hooks have been cleared - add new ones following the latest PocketBase patterns
- All commit hooks now only run on frontend code in `client/`
- Backend runs on port 8090 (change in scripts if needed)

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished!

Your project is now a clean, modern Go+React monorepo with:
- ✅ Latest PocketBase API compatibility
- ✅ Clean separation of frontend/backend concerns
- ✅ Proper tooling isolation
- ✅ Comprehensive extension documentation
- ✅ Working development workflow

Happy coding! 🚀
