# Specification Quality Checklist: Clean and Refactor Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All checklist items pass** âœ…

**Specific validations performed:**
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P4) and independently testable
- Requirements use specific, measurable language ("improve by 20%", "under 10 minutes")
- Success criteria are business-focused and technology-agnostic
- No framework-specific details (React, Go, etc.) mentioned in requirements
- Each functional requirement is verifiable through testing
- Edge cases cover realistic refactoring scenarios

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All requirements focus on WHAT needs to be achieved rather than HOW
- Success criteria provide clear, measurable targets for completion
